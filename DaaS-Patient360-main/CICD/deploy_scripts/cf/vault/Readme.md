    credentials, SQL/NoSQL databases, X.509 certificates, SSH credentials, and more.

**Features**
    
    1. CF Credentials in Vault
    2. Config File in Vault - Entire Config File is stored in Vault with Base64 Encode and Decode
    3. Read Config File from Vault - No Storage in Filesystem/Bitbucket Repo
    4. Pub Key File(RSA) in Vault - Entire Pub File is stored in Vault with Base64 Encode and Decode    
  
**Prerequisites and Installation**

**Step 3:** Create service Key

`        Command: cf create-service-key <VaultServiceInstance> <MyKey>`
        
**Step4:** If you want to know the vault keys, run the following. This is for your information

`        Command: cf service-key <ValutServiceName> <MyKey>`

	        
**Step4:** Following Step to upload file to Vault and also download from vault.
