# In this example, any change inside the `/apps` directory
# will require approval from a member of the @example-org/content team.
# If a member of @example-org/content opens a pull request 
# with a change inside the `/apps` directory, their approval is implicit.
# The team is still added as a reviewer but not a required reviewer.
# Anyone can approve the changes.
